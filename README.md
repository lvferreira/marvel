QANinja_Marvel-API

In this project you can see what I've learned in the Automation Week; 3 days of online free training provided by QA Ninja Academy.

As baseline, it has a Json file that can be used in Insomnia to do the manual API tests. It has functions as Login; Add Characters; GetAll; GetById and Delete Character.

The purpose of this training was to demonstrate the Robot Framework ability to automate API tests. So, the test strategy was to divide it by routes: In the file Character.robot you can see keywords implements to the API's: 
New Character
Get Character By Id
Delete Character By Id

As test data instead of using csv file; we implemented methods in Python to generate it; instead of use faker from Robot. 

As report we learnt the advantages of using Robot Framework Report; but also how to use the Allure Report.

If you enjoyed this implementation; you can encourage me to continue to study and improve my skills in automation giving me a star on this Repository.

I'm still learning Robot Framework and I'm totally in love with it; so soon as I improve my skills on it; I'll publish automation in other layers as well.
